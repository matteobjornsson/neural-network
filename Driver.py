import numpy as np

# set arguments such as how many hidden layers, how many nodes per hidden layer
# identify if the data set is regression, if not, how many classes? 
# init a neural network with these input parameters
# chunk training data into batches (?)
# repeat until error value converges (?)
#   pass forward and backprop on each batch of input X
# once Neural network converges, stop training
# pass in test data on the network and get classification results
# run the results processing on data (mean squared error, F1, etc)
